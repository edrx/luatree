#+TITLE: luatree.mac: draw Maxima objects as trees (using Lua)

* Introduction

This is my first Maxima program that falls in the "worth sharing"
class. I have very little experience with both Maxima and Common Lisp,
so all suggestions are very welcome.

In this version the paths are still hardcoded. See [[https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/mailman/message/37689770/][this message]] that I
sent to the Maxima mailing list.

For htmlized versions of the source files in which all the [[http://angg.twu.net/#eev][eev]]-isms
are hmlized correctly, follow these links: [[http://angg.twu.net/luatree/luatree.mac.html][luatree.mac]], [[http://angg.twu.net/luatree/luatree.lisp.html][luatree.lisp]],
